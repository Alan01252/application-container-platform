# KPI's

As part of DSP (Digital Services Project), we want a way of proving the benefits of the services we deliver that are either contributors, or consumers
of the services we are delivering, whether the service is a platform, a component of the platform or a microservice / library or framework reuse.

## Prove Reusability - Framework

* ROTM will be used as a method for proving reusability of the HOF forms as well as reusability of the platform for hosting in development.
* We will measure the KPI metric, based on the time it has taken to produce the form and release it into the development environment
* We will eventually aim for a one month delivery time for a new form
